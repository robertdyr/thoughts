# thoughts

repository contains thoughts i had or questions i wondered about (and their answers). 
i typically write down my thoughts and let AI summarize it in a markdown once it feels right and i answered my own question. 
ai often makes it sound overly formal or like philosophical/ai slop, but i cba to change the wording. 
so while the ideas defentily hold true, its not as serious as the wording may make it sound.
